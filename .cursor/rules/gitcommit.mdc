description: Rules for conventional git commits
globs: 
---
Here's the breakdown of the commit message:

- **`📝 chore:`**: General updates to the code that do not affect the app's functionality (like updating configs).
- **`✨ feat(<scope>):`**: A new feature for the user, or a change that implies some sort of enhancement.
- **`🐛 fix(<scope>):`**: A bug fix for the user.
- **`🎨 style(<scope>):`**: Improvements or corrections to the style/formatting of the code.
- **`🧪 test(<scope>):`**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones.
- **`📚 docs:`**: Documentation-only changes.
- **`📦 refactor:`**: Changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature, typically code refactoring.

Remember to replace **`<scope>`** with the part of the application that is affected (e.g., **`ui-components`**, **`auth`**).
